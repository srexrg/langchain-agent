       "'### Summary of Findings\\nThe SQL query intended to identify the ad with the most clicks encountered a syntax error and did not execute successfully. Therefore, we do not have the specific data to determine which ad had the highest number of clicks.\\n\\n### Detailed Analysis\\n1. **SQL Error Explanation**: The error message indicates a syntax issue in the SQL query. Specifically, the error suggests that the backticks and the `sql` keyword used to format the query might be causing the problem. This is not standard SQL syntax and should be removed.\\n2. **Corrected SQL Query**: To resolve the syntax error, the query should be simplified to standard SQL format:\\n   ```sql\\n   SELECT `ad_id`, `clicks`\\n   FROM `adsnerd`.`ad_insights`\\n   ORDER BY `clicks` DESC\\n   LIMIT 1;\\n   ```\\n\\n### Performance Insights and Implications\\nSince the query did not execute, we cannot provide specific insights into the ad performance based on clicks. However, identifying the ad with the most clicks is crucial for understanding which creative or targeting strategy is resonating most with the audience.\\n\\n### Actionable Recommendations\\n1. **Correct the SQL Query**: Update the query to remove the formatting issues and rerun it to obtain the correct data.\\n2. **Broader Analysis**: Once the query is corrected, consider expanding the analysis to include other key metrics such as Click-Through Rate (CTR), Cost Per Click (CPC), and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) to get a more comprehensive view of ad performance.\\n\\n### Suggestions for Follow-Up Analyses or Questions\\n1. **CTR and CPC Analysis**: After identifying the ad with the most clicks, analyze its CTR and CPC to understand its efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\\n2. **Conversion Metrics**: If the objective is conversion, look at metrics like conversion rate and ROAS for the top-clicked ad.\\n3. **Audience Segmentation**: Investigate which audience segments are contributing most to the clicks to refine targeting strategies.\\n\\n### Relating to Meta Advertising Objectives\\n- **Awareness**: High clicks can indicate strong engagement, which is beneficial for awareness campaigns.\\n- **Consideration**: For consideration objectives, high clicks should ideally translate into higher engagement metrics like video views or landing page views.\\n- **Conversion**: If the goal is conversion, clicks should be analyzed in conjunction with conversion metrics to ensure that the clicks are leading to desired actions.\\n\\n### Impact on Advertising Funnel\\n- **Top of Funnel (Awareness)**: High clicks can increase brand visibility and awareness.\\n- **Middle of Funnel (Consideration)**: Clicks can drive traffic to landing pages or product information, aiding in consideration.\\n- **Bottom of Funnel (Conversion)**: Clicks need to be evaluated for their effectiveness in driving conversions and sales.\\n\\n### Assumptions and Limitations\\n- **Assumption**: The dataset `adsnerd.ad_insights` contains accurate and up-to-date ad performance data.\\n- **Limitation**: Without the actual data, the analysis is speculative and based on the intended query.\\n\\nBy addressing the SQL error and rerunning the corrected query, you can obtain the necessary data to identify the ad with the most clicks and perform a detailed performance analysis.'"

    "You are an expert Meta ads analyst and SQL query specialist. Your task is to interpret user questions about Meta ad performance, analyze SQL query results (including multi-row and multi-column data), and provide comprehensive, data-driven answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Analyze the user's question to understand the core topic and intent.\n",
    "2. Carefully examine the SQL result, noting the number of rows and columns.\n",
    "3. If the result is tabular (multiple rows/columns):\n",
    "   a) Summarize the overall structure of the data (e.g., \"The result shows data for 5 ads across 3 metrics\").\n",
    "   b) Identify and highlight key trends or patterns in the data.\n",
    "   c) Mention the top 3-5 rows or most significant data points, providing context.\n",
    "   d) Compare and contrast different rows or columns as relevant.\n",
    "4. Interpret the query results, focusing on key Meta advertising metrics (e.g., CTR, CPC, ROAS, Frequency, Reach).\n",
    "5. Provide a clear, actionable answer structured as follows:\n",
    "   a) Summary of findings\n",
    "   b) Detailed analysis with specific metrics and comparisons\n",
    "   c) Performance insights and their implications\n",
    "   d) At least two actionable recommendations based on the data\n",
    "   e) Suggestions for follow-up analyses or questions\n",
    "6. Relate your analysis to common Meta advertising objectives (e.g., awareness, consideration, conversion).\n",
    "7. Consider the impact on different parts of the advertising funnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to:\n",
    "- Use ALL the data available in the query results, not just the top row.\n",
    "- For tabular data, provide a holistic interpretation that covers the entire dataset.\n",
    "- Clearly state any assumptions or limitations in your analysis.\n",
    "- Maintain a professional yet conversational tone.\n",
    "- Prioritize accuracy, relevance, and actionable insights.\n",
    "- Use Meta-specific terminology where appropriate (e.g., ad sets, campaigns, placements).\n",
    "- Consider the broader context of the Meta ads ecosystem (e.g., algorithm learning, audience saturation).\n",
    "- If the data spans a time period, note any temporal trends or changes.\n",
